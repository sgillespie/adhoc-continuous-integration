## Introduction
There are several open source Continuous Integration (CI) tools available. 
Unfortunately, when choosing a CI tool, one must make compromises. We believe 
that CI software should be

 * Open Source
 * Easy to Install
 * Easy to Scale
 * Usable in the Cloud or on Bare Metal

Fortunately, with the emergence of Docker, we can easily build such a tool.
We present this system in the following sections.

## What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration is more than a piece of software, it's a practice. While the
focus of this paper is on the software, we briefly discuss these two topics.

### The Practice
Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating changes into a shared
mainline [@fowler2006]. With modern Version Control Systems (VCS), this means that developers
are merging their commits into `master`, or a shared `develop` branch.

Along with this practice, Continuous Integration also has the following guidelines [@fowler2006]:

 * Automate the Build
 * Make the Build Self Testing
 * Every Commit Should Build on an Integration Machine

Continuous Integration software attempts to automate these.

### Continuous Integration Software
The role of CI software is build the project after each commit. The benefit
is that developers are notified of failures as soon as possible. The sooner
a bug is identified, the less expensive it is to fix [@sankey2006].

A CI job run generally looks like this [@engineyard2012]:

 1. Check out a clean copy of the repository
 2. Build the code
 3. Run the test suite

## Prerequisites
Our CI system will be built with Docker, Docker Swarm, and Docker Compose. We use newer
features, so our dependencies will be

 * Docker Engine >= 17.05
 * Docker Compose >= 1.10

## Using Docker Build
Initially, our CI job use the following process:

 1. Check out a clean copy of the repository
 2. Build and test the code
 3. Build a Docker image

The output will be an image that can run our code. We can achieve this by using
docker build, with the new multi-stage feature.

### Multi-stage Builds
Docker 17.05+ contains a new feature called multi-stage builds. With multi-stage
builds, we build multiple containers, called stages, in a single Dockerfile. We
can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another. Each stage begins with 
a `FROM` instruction, and the last stage results in the output image [@docker-multistage].

Here is an example from the Docker [User Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds):

    FROM golang:1.7.3
    WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/
    RUN go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html  
    COPY app.go .
    RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app .

    FROM alpine:latest  
    RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
    WORKDIR /root/
    COPY --from=0 /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app .
    CMD ["./app"]

### Using Multi-stage Builds
We now create a Node.js builder. The output will be an nginx image, serving only
static content built from the following commands:

    npm install
    npm test
    npm run build

Furthermore, we assume `npm run build` will generate artifacts in `build/`.

First, we check out a clean copy of the repository:

    FROM node:slim as git-builder
    ARG GIT_URL
    RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install git
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    RUN git clone $GIT_URL .

We define a build argument `GIT_URL`, allowing us to pass the git clone URL
of the project we want to build

We now define a second stage to build the project:

    FROM node:slim as node-builder
    COPY --from=git-builder /usr/src/app /usr/src/app
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    RUN npm install && \
    npm run test && \
    npm run build

The argument `--from=git-builder` in the `COPY` instruction copies the source
tree from the first stage to the second.

We define a final stage to create the output image:

    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY --from=node-builder /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

Combining these stages into a single Dockerfile, we have

    FROM node:slim as git-builder
    ARG GIT_URL
    RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install git
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    RUN git clone $GIT_URL .

    FROM node:slim as node-builder
    COPY --from=git-builder /usr/src/app /usr/src/app
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    RUN npm install && \
    npm run test && \
    npm run build

    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY --from=node-builder /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

We can now execute the build using the `docker build` command. In this example
we will build [React Boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/):

    docker build \
        --build-arg "GIT_URL=https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git" \
        -t react-boilerplate \
        .

Finally, we can run the output image:

    docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 react-boilerplate

The demo page is now available at <http://localhost>.
